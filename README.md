# Patient-Stroke-Prediction
A stroke, also known as a brain attack, happens when the blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked or when a blood artery in the brain bursts. In either scenario, portions of the brain are injured or lost, which can result in permanent brain damage, permanent disability, and even death. In the United States, one of the main causes of death is stroke. Approximately 795,000 Americans get strokes annually, and 137,000 of them result in fatalities, which means that, a stroke occurs every 40 seconds, and every 3.5 minutes, a stroke-related death occurs . However, although a stroke can occur to anyone at any age, it is closely related to some of the body conditions, such as obesity and cholesterol level, which can be used to form a model to predict whether a patient has a high risk of stroke or not, as long as enough data exists, so that precautions could be taken to reduce the death rate.
In this project, the source of the dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. The dataset gathers about 5000 patientsâ€™ body conditions and whether they got a stroke or not. Hence, it is useful to use this dataset to train a predicting model after careful analysis and manipulations.
